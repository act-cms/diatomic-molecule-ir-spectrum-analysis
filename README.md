The reference_data directory contains the following files:

- hcl-fundamental-ftir.txt: Experimental P- and R-branch lines in the fundamental spectrum of H$^{35}$Cl. Lines positions are tabulated in the second column in units of cm$^{-1}$. Values in the first column correspond to the variable m, and are related to the rotational quantum number of the initial level (J) as follows
	- m = -J      for P-branch lines
	- m = J + 1   for R-branch lines

- hcl-fundamental-ftir.txt: Experimental P- and R-branch lines in the 1$^{\rm st}$ overtone spectrum of H$^{35}$Cl.

- dcl-fundamental-ftir.txt: Experimental P- and R-branch lines in the fundamental spectrum of D$^{35}$Cl.

- dcl-fundamental-ftir.txt: Experimental P- and R-branch lines in the 1$^{\rm st}$ overtone spectrum of D$^{35}$Cl.
